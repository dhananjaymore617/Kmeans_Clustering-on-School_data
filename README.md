# Kmeans_Clustering-on-School_data
This project applies K-Means clustering to group schools based on infrastructure, student–teacher ratio, classrooms, and a Digital Readiness Index (DRI). The model identifies distinct school clusters to support data-driven planning, resource allocation, and Digital Twin–based educational insights.
